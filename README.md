LEAST SIGNIFICANT BIT (LSB) STEGANOGRAPHY WITH ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) ALGORITHM

ABSTRACT:
In our interconnected digital world, secure communication is of paramount importance. Hacking, phishing, and malware attacks continually threaten sensitive data, making data security and privacy 
preservation top priorities. One approach to secure communication involves combining image steganography, AES encryption, and randomization techniques. Image steganography hides information within
digital images, making it difficult to detect. AES encryption, a widely accepted encryption algorithm, renders data indecipherable without the correct decryption key. Randomization techniques add an 
additional layer of unpredictability, making it even harder for unauthorized parties to breach security. This strategy enables covert data transfer, allowing secure communication without revealing the
existence of hidden messages. This capability is invaluable in government, corporate, and personal communications where data security is critical. Secure data transfer is vital in a society where data 
breaches can have severe consequences. Upholding trust and confidence in digital communication and transactions is essential. Future research opportunities abound in expanding the applications of image 
steganography and enhancing this approach to stay ahead of emerging threats. As technology evolves and security challenges change, the quest for innovative and effective secure communication methods remains
a priority.
In today's hyperconnected digital landscape, ensuring the security of communication is of paramount significance. The relentless onslaught of cyber threats, including hacking, phishing, and malware attacks, 
poses a constant danger to sensitive information. As a result, safeguarding data security and preserving privacy has become an overarching concern. One compelling approach to achieving secure communication 
is the fusion of image steganography, AES encryption, and randomization techniques. Image steganography provides a clandestine method for concealing information within digital images, rendering detection 
remarkably challenging. AES encryption, a globally recognized encryption standard, transforms data into an unintelligible format unless decrypted with the correct key. The integration of randomization techniques
further enhances security by introducing an additional layer of unpredictability, thereby thwarting unauthorized access and fortifying data protection. This strategy empowers covert data transmission, 
facilitating secure communication while concealing the existence of concealed messages. Its applicability spans across diverse domains, including government, corporate, and personal communications, where data
security is non-negotiable. In a society where data breaches can result in dire consequences, secure data transfer plays a pivotal role. Upholding trust and confidence in digital communication and transactions
is indispensable, and this integrated approach serves as a robust bastion of defence.Looking forward, the horizons of research opportunities in this domain are expansive. Future investigations can explore the 
broader applications of image steganography and seek to refine this approach to proactively address emerging security threats. As technology evolves and security challenges continually morph, the pursuit of
innovative and effective methods for secure communication remains at the forefront of our endeavours. The preservation of data integrity and privacy is not just a priority; it is a commitment to a safer and more 
trustworthy digital world.
